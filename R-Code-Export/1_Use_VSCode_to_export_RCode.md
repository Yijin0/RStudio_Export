# Exporting R code to Word with syntax highlighting

Why bother? If you copy R code in RStudio and paste the code onto a Word document, formatting will be lost. As all the text will be shown in black, readers will find reading your code challenging.
You have two options.

Option 1: Export R code using rmarkdown (see the attached Rmd file)

Option 2: Export R code using Visual Studio Code
Alternatively, you can simply open an R script in Visual Studio Code. VS Code is free to download here: (https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

Launch VS Code > bottom-left ⚙️ >  Themes > Color Theme > Select any Light theme > Drag open an R script file > Copy and paste the code onto a Word document.
