# Embedding R code

We press **Ctrl (Cmd) + Alt + I**.

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

Does it amaze you? Well, using rmarkdown is much more complex than the above example! Your data analysis steps involve multiple stages and you'll be selective in presenting results.

In practice, you'll run the entire file first then load the objects before printing. This is an example only, and the output will not be printed.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
source("F/Git_public/Support/SRMS-Workshop/R-Source-Scripts/Code_to_test1.R")

```
```{r}
# Figure
p1_carspeed

# Desc stats (specify obj name)
# descstats
```

#  Styles and formatting 
Use a Word template. Go to Styles tab and choose Heading. Modify as appropriate. Specify at the top as reference_docx:yourtemplate.docx.

Also see BB for tutorial on Styles. 


Well-done! üëç
